## Predicting Forest Fires
This project uses publicly available data, found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires), from a paper by Cortez and Morais [2007].

#### **Attribute Information:**
This dataset consists of two geographical features, two temporal features, four [Fire Weather Index (FWI)](https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms437/cffdrs/fire-weather-index-system) features, four meteorological data features, and our target: area. 
- X: x-axis value corresponding to location of fire on map of Montesinho park [Cortez and Morais, 2007] 
- Y: y-axis value corresponding to location of fire on map of Montesinho park [Cortez and Morais, 2007] 
- month: month of the year- "jan" to "dec"
- day: day of the week- "mon" to "sun"
- FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code from FWI system
- DMC: Duff Moisture Code from FWI system
- DC: Drought Code from FWI system
- ISI: Initial Spread Index from FWI system
- temp: temperature (&deg;C)
- RH: relative humidity (%)
- wind: wind speed (km/h)
- rain: accumulated precipitation from previous 30 minutes (mm/m<sup>2</sup>)
- area: total area burned (ha)

Note: The majority of the dataset was already clean and did not require further transformation. However, the area feature was an exception; 47.8% of the recorded fires were values of 0.0 hectares, which produced a right skewed target variable. These zero values actually represent areas of less than 0.01 ha, or 100 m<sup>2</sup>.
